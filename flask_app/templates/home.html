            <p>I recently graduated from Michigan State University with dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Media and Information. This unique combination positions me at the intersection of design and engineering. I don't just design interfaces—I build them.</p>
            <p>My Computer Science background provides me with solid technical foundations in system architecture, algorithms, and full-stack development, while my Media and Information studies developed my expertise in user research, interaction design, and visual communication. This dual perspective allows me to own the complete design-to-implementation pipeline and deliver production-ready applications.</p>
            <p>What makes my approach distinctive is that I speak both languages fluently. I can conduct user interviews to identify pain points, translate insights into high-fidelity prototypes, then architect and implement the frontend with clean, maintainable code. Whether I'm designing component systems in Figma or building them in React, deploying with Docker to Google Cloud Platform, or implementing real-time features with SocketIO, I focus on creating experiences that users love and systems that scale.</p>
            <p>Outside of my professional work, I'm constantly involved with the arts and love creating illustrations—it's my creative outlet that keeps me thinking about visual storytelling and how design elements communicate meaning. This constant exploration of visual language informs how I approach interface design and user experience.</p>
            <p>I'm actively seeking opportunities at companies that value the intersection of design and engineering, where I can contribute to both the visual language and technical implementation of products that matter.</p>
